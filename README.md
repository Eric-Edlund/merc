Merc
====

A tool for compiling CubedOS message definitions into message encoding/decoding subprograms.

Merc is the CubedOS interface definition language (IDL) compiler. This tool converts a
description of CubedOS messages into appropriate, provable SPARK packages. The IDL is an
extended version of the eXternal Data Representation (XDR) standard described in RFC-4506. We
call our extended XDR "modified" XDR, or MXDR.

Build Instructions
------------------

Merc is an [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) based project. After installing a suitable
JVM (we recommend version 11.x.y for some x, y) and SBT, run an SBT interactive session while
inside the top level Merc folder. There you can use the usual SBT commands such as `compile`,
`package`, `test`, and `assembly` to build and exercise the code. Any IDE that supports SBT
integration, such as IntelliJ can also be used.
