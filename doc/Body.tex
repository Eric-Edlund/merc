\section{Requirements}

\subsection{Introduction}

Merc is a tool that comes open source with CubedOS, a modular application framework for small
satellites. Merc is written in Scala and takes as user input a subset of the specified formal
language of XDR (with some modification) and produces provable SPARK 2014 as output (*.ads and
concomitant *.adb). The user may then manually insert the code into their project and test it.
The SPARK 2014 code generated by Merc shall be the procedures and functions used to encode
and decode CubedOS messages for inter-modular communications—repetitive, boilerplate-like code.

\subsection{Key Features}

\begin{itemize}
\item Uses a modified form of a subset of the XDR formal language.
\item Produces provable SPARK 2014.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{How It Works}

The user of CubedOS specifies through the XDR formal language subset defined in the RFC-4506
which modules will be able to encode and/or decode which kinds of CubedOS messages. Merc will
then generate provable SPARK 2014 for each module, based on the module and its capabilities.

\subsection{Competitive Analysis}

Most, if not all, primary competitors to CubedOS, such as those written in C (e.g. cFE [6]),
pass around Space Packets inter-modularly with no special internal encoding/decoding procedures
for separate ‘proprietary messages.’

Most primary competitors to the Merc tool, such as ONC RPC [2], Ice [3], Java RMI [4], and
WSDL [5], take a formal language (generally a data representation language) and package it up
client-side to send it over a network to a server that subsequently decomposes the code into
some other, executable code to perform an action server-side.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{ONC RPC} is the closest in similarity to Merc in that it uses an XDR language
  extension (RPC language) client-side to initiate a RPC (Remote Procedure Call). The biggest
  difference is that ONC RPC was designed to be used two-way over an open network, whereas
  Merc simply generates provable SPARK 2014 files.

\item \textbf{Ice} is like ONC RPC except that it uses a proprietary language called Slice which
  is then compiled to a more widely used language, such as C, C\#, Java, JavaScript, or Python,
  etc., server-side after traversing a network as the payload of a common Internet transmissions
  protocol, such as TCP/IP or UDP.

\item \textbf{Java RMI} is like Ice, but only uses Java and the JVM for two-way data transfers.

\item \textbf{WSDL} is like Java RMI, but uses WSDL (Web Services Description Language).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Use Cases}

Using the RFC-4506 as reference, the user of CubedOS specifies for a particular module what it
can handle in terms of encoding and decoding a subset of the pre-defined kinds of CubedOS
messages. The tool, Merc, is then invoked over the appropriate directory using a command-line
(CMD) syntax as illustrated in Appendix A. Merc then outputs provable SPARK 2014 which can be
manually placed into a project. The code is then statically tested.

\subsection{Behavior Characteristics}

Merc must be robust enough to handle all conceivable forms of human error and output a
message aimed at the elucidation of the user in each case of error, no matter how obscure or
intentional.

Merc must be simple enough, both in user learning and understanding of the tool and its
use—in functionality and use-restrictions—that a reasonable (and even novice) user could
successfully insert the encode and decode SPARK 2014 procedures and functions into their CubedOS
project with minor to no difficulty.

Merc takes as input a modified subset of the XDR language as an XDR file which handles
Integer, Unsigned Integer, Enumeration, Boolean, Fixed-Length Opaque Data, Variable-Length
Opaque Data, String, Fixed-Length Array, Variable-Length Array, Structure, and Typedef as
defined in RFC-4506 [1].

Merc shall modify the XDR specification to include ranges of types. E.g. typedef:

\begin{verbatim}
type-def:          
 "typedef" declaration ";"
\end{verbatim} 

shall become:

\begin{verbatim}
type-def:
"typedef" declaration  (“range” const “..” const )? ";"         
\end{verbatim}

Merc shall incorporate the ``message struct'' which is split by Merc into a SPARK enum, a
decode procedure, an encode function and a message “check” that verifies the message based on
its sender parameter and the type of message as proscribed in its message ID. E.g.:

\begin{verbatim}
message struct Example {
	Width_Type thing;
	};
\end{verbatim}

shall produce:

\begin{verbatim}
type Message_Type is (Example);
function Example_Encode 
	(sender: standard_with_all_messages; 
	thing: Width_Type; 
	priority: also_standard_with_all_messages);

in the SPARK *.ads file.
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Representational Characteristics}

Merc shall be written in Scala and output provable SPARK 2014. As input, Merc accepts a
modified XDR file.

\subsection{Extrapolation}

Client-side Merc could very well insert an XDR file into the payload of a UDP or TCP/IP
protocol packet and be sent across a network (or even the Internet) to then produce an
executable outputted in SPARK 2014. This would require modification to the Scala used to write
the ANTLR generated compiler and would result in a product like those mentioned in Competitive
Analysis. This would also require intimate knowledge of the server to which the meta-packet is
sent, including having Merc set up server-side to accept an XDR file from the payload of a
meta-packet and decompose the file into a SPARK executable intended to be executed, typically,
on that same server. Then Merc server-side could reciprocate based on the instructions in the
SPARK executable.

\subsection{Examples}

<<Need all generally unique examples of modified XDR and it’s SPARK 2014 output not already
shown in Behavioral Characteristics. Need to dive into implementation first to know what needs
to be added to this section.>>

\subsection{System Level Design}

\subsection{System Goals}

The goal of Merc is to ease the implementation of CubedOS on its user. The user inputs a
modified XDR file and receives as output verified SPARK 2014.

Client-side Merc could very well insert an XDR file into the payload of a UDP or TCP/IP
protocol packet and be sent across a network (or even the Internet) to then produce an
executable outputted in SPARK 2014. This would require modification to the Scala used to write
the ANTLR generated compiler and would result in a product like those mentioned in Competitive
Analysis of the Merc Requirements document. This would also require intimate knowledge of the
server to which the meta-packet is sent, including having Merc set up server-side to accept
an XDR file from the payload of a meta-packet and decompose the file into a SPARK executable
intended to be executed, typically, on that same server. Then Merc server-side could
reciprocate based on the instructions in the SPARK executable.

\subsection{Key Components}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Scala} is a general-purpose-language running on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
  that is a Frankenstein mixture of functional and imperative programming. Here it is being used
  to create the ANTLR-based compiler tool Merc.

\item \textbf{XDR} is a C-derived Data Representation Language, similar to XML, designed to move
  the data itself from one node to another.

\item \textbf{Grammar} is an arbitrary set of rules, each one expressing the structure of a
  phrase. ANTLR translates a grammar to a parser.

\item \textbf{Lexer} is an ANTLR generated file custom designed to perform lexical analysis (or
  tokenizing) on the modified XDR input. The lexer groups related tokens into token types (INT,
  ID, FLOAT, etc.) A token consists of two pieces of information: token type and the text
  matched for the token by the lexer.

\item \textbf{Parser} is also an ANTLR generated file, based off a supplied grammar, that cares
  only about the type of an individual token. The parser uses a parse tree (or syntax tree) to
  recognize the structure of the input sentence and its component phrases. ANTLR parsers descend
  recursively, beginning at the root of the parse tree and proceeding toward the leaves
  (tokens).

\item \textbf{Parse Tree} is generated from the parser, the parse tree is easy to process in
  subsequent steps and is reusable. The inner nodes of the parse tree are phrase names that
  group and identify their children, with the root node being the most abstract phrase name. The
  leaves of a parse tree are the input tokens.

\item \textbf{Semantic Analyzer} is a user provided file intended to ensure that the meaning of
  the sentence structure is correct. Whereas the other files are concerned with the correctness
  of the sentence syntax and the correct structure of the generated parse tree, the semantic
  analyzer makes sure that the sentence structure makes sense from the point-of-view of the
  Merc user.

\item \textbf{SPARK} SPARK 2014 is a subset language of Ada 2012 released April 30, 2014. This
  High Integrity Language incorporates parts of the Ada 2012 language that can be run through
  certain tools built into SPARK IDEs that run mathematical calculations on the provided code to
  ensure that the code meets the design objectives of SPARK: logical soundness, semantic
  soundness, security, verifiability, bounded resource requirements, and runtime system
  requirements. The other design objective of SPARK 2014 was to find a meeting point between
  maintaining rigorous formal definition while not sacrificing its expressive and artistic
  power. The first version of SPARK was designed by University of Southampton Bernard Carre and
  Trevor Jennings based on the original Ada ’83. It has subsequently been revamped typically 2
  to 3 years after each of Ada’s revamping’s.

  With SPARK 2014, contracts were added to the code to improve tools such as GNATprove in
  determining the designer’s intentions by comparing the contract along with its pre, post and
  verification conditions against what the code is doing. This makes for the prevention of the
  hypothetical scenario where, even though the code is doing something legal and correct, it
  still wasn’t the designer’s intention. Also, contracts help for an added layer of security and
  verifiability in general and can help the designer through the coding process.

  Here is an example of a SPARK procedure with a contract comprised of one precondition and one
  postcondition:
\begin{verbatim}
			procedure Locate_Node(Position : out Node_Index)
    		   	  with Pre => not isFull,
    		   	  Post => Node_Array(Position).used = False
   		 	is
   		 	begin
\end{verbatim}
  
  Industrially, SPARK 2014 is currently ubiquitous, especially in the security and safety
  realms. Vermont Technical College (VTC) is currently using SPARK 2014 in its Lunar Ice Cube
  project.

  The most important line of any SPARK program in order that it be differentiated from original
  Ada:
\begin{verbatim}
			pragma SPARK_Mode(On);
\end{verbatim}			

  This one-liner designates that what follows, along with the file’s associated files (the
  specification file that defines public and private functions and procedures, the body file
  that holds the complete functions and procedures of the project itself, and the main file that
  manipulates public functions and procedures in the specification file), is in fact SPARK and
  not full Ada.

  What exactly separates Ada from SPARK? SPARK has no access types such as pointers, no
  unstructured control flow such as goto’s, no exception handling, no aliasing of outputs from
  subprograms, and no side-effects in expressions and functions. All these “normal things” found
  in many other languages make the formal reasoning and mathematical verifications much harder,
  at very least, if not impossible.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Component Interactions}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{USE CASE} The user of CubedOS creates a modified XDR file intended to generate two
  SPARK 2014 output files: *.ads and concomitant *.adb. Internally, the lexical analyzer and
  parser (with the generated parse tree) have all been automatically generated in Scala based on
  the supplied grammar. The modified XDR is tokenized by the lexical analyzer and subsequently
  parsed by the parser using the parse tree. This results in a stream of chars that is then sent
  to the semantic analyzer for a check of intended logical soundness. SPARK 2014 (*.ads and
  *.adb) is then generated based on the correctness of the original modified XDR input.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Code Level Design}

Since approximately half of the files in this Merc compiler pipeline are auto-generated by
the ANTLR tool, the three distinct areas of focus at the code level are the grammar, the
semantic analyzer, and the code generation. The grammar and semantic analyzer are each a file.
Code generation requires multiple files and references to the outputs of the other phases of the
compiler pipeline, namely the parse tree.

SPARK skeletons (*.ads and *.adb) are filled in by the code generation phase after the previous
compiler phases check the soundness and validity of the modified XDR.

\subsection{Code Goals}

Code goals include simplicity, readability/understandability, and—of course—executability.

\subsection{Code Level Plan for Implementation and Explanation}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Modified XDR} For each module, the CubedOS user creates a modified XDR file
  (*.mxdr) consisting of a message struct per message type. The name the user supplies to the
  first enum invariably named Module will replace MODULENAME in the correct template, delimited
  by \%. The second enum is used to identify n-number of types of messages in this template, all
  of which must be explicitly associated with ascending and incremental values beginning at 1.
  Each enum must be a message type outlined in the Appendix B. The *.mxdr files are then placed
  in a folder. The various typedefs following the enums are used for the input parameter list of
  each function/procedure then outlined in each message struct. There is a direct, one-to-one
  correspondence between the Message\_Type enum and the number of message structs. Merc is
  then invoked using the command-line syntax and options outlined in this document. The output
  of this process is shown in SPARK Output.
\begin{verbatim}
enum { Publish_Subscribe };
enum Message_Type { Subscribe_Request, Subscribe_Reply, 
   Publish_Request, Publish_Reply, Publish_Result };

typedef unsigned int Channel_ID range 1 .. 16;
typedef Boolean Status_Current;



message struct {
    Channel_ID             Channel;
} Subscribe_Request;

message struct {
    Channel_ID             Channel;
    Status_Current         Status;
} Subscribe_Reply;

message struct {
    Channel_ID             Channel;
    Opaque<>               Message_Data;
} Publish_Request;

message struct {
    Channel_ID             Channel;
    Status_Current         Status;
} Publish_Reply;

message struct {
    Channel_ID             Channel;
    Opaque<>               Message_Data;
} Publish_Result;
\end{verbatim}
  
\item \textbf{Grammar} The grammar consists of the rules that construct the lexical analyzer,
  the parser and, thus, the parse tree. An example can be found in Appendix A.

\item \textbf{Parse Tree} A parse tree is an ordered, rooted tree that represents the syntactic
  structure of a string according to a context-free grammar. A parse tree is generated for each
  input of modified XDR. Leaf nodes in the parse tree are containers that point at tokens in the
  token stream. The tokens record start and stop character indexes into the ChatStream, rather
  than making copies of substrings. ANTLR provides support for two tree-walking mechanisms in
  its runtime library: listener design pattern and visitor design pattern.
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Listener Design Pattern} By default, ANTLR generates a parse tree listener
    interface that responds to events triggered by the built-in tree walker. The listeners
    receive notification of events. To make a language application, a ParseTreeListener is built
    and implemented for each grammar with enter and exit methods for each rule. As the walker
    encounters the node for a hypothetical rule assign, it triggers enterAssign() and passes it
    the AssignContext parse tree node. After the walker visits all children of the assign node,
    it triggers exitAssign(). The tree diagram below shows ParseTreeWalker performing a
    depth-first walk, represented by the dashed line.

  \item \textbf{Visitor Design Pattern} When the walk must be controlled, explicitly calling
    methods to visit children, option -visitor asks ANTLR to generate a visitor interface from a
    grammar with a visit method per rule.
  \end{itemize}

\item textbf{Semantic Analyzer} Semantic analysis involves checking that the *.mxdr file
  presented to Merc follows the specified rules of modified XDR required. For example,
  internal to Merc, if a certain module identification from Appendix B is used in the
  modified XDR file, then one aspect of semantic analysis will be to make sure the inputted
  parameter list and any possible flags or identifiers associated are valid for that module
  type.

\item \textbf{SPARK Skeletons} A generic SPARK template with exactly 5 types of messages to be
  auto-generated into the file.
